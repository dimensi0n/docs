## Usage

Use the `signin` route with the following body to generate the JWT token :

```
POST /signin

Body:
    - name: The admin name given in FLUME_FILE_STORAGE_ADMIN by default it's simply "admin"

Return:
    - If success :
        - A JWT Token
        - The cookie with the previously generated JWT Token
    - If failed :
        - Unauthorized Status
        - Bad request Status
```

Check if the jwt is correctly generated by visiting `welcome` route :

```
GET /welcome

Return:
    - If success :
        - Welcome to you visitor !
    - If failed :
        - Unauthorized Status
```

Then upload a file using the `post` route with multipart encoded data :

```
POST /post

Body:
    - file: The file to upload
    - need_auth: set to "yes" if the user has to bee authenticated to access the file, otherwise sset to "no"

Return:
  - If success:
      - The file name which you can use to access the file
  - If failed:
      - Internal Server Error Status
```

If you want to access a private file (need authentication) use `/private/<filename>` (ensure that you are signed in).

Otherwise if you want to access a public file (doesn't need authentication) use `public/<filename>`.
